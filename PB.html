                <p>Last year I realized that I was not feeling fullfilled in my career path and needed to make a change. I have had an interest in computers since I was a kid, but never really thought of pursuing it as a career.
                    I have been studying for 1 semester now and really feel I have found the right fit. <br><br>
                    Those that know me well would describe me as a positive curious person.
                    I like to solve problems and being creative, have a big interest in music and martial arts. My previous university studies and work experience have made me feel
                    that with enough time given the opportunity and guidance, I can do anything I set my mind to. If my profile peeks you're interest, feel free to contact me or take
                    a look at my github to see what I'm currently working on. 
                    <br><br>
                    Take care!
                </p>
